## Example of functionality: 
1. User should be able to input a todo item 
2. If item done should be able to click on it and strikethrough
3. User should be able to delete a task
4. User should be able to clear all tasks
  
## Overview of logic: 
1. When user enters a new task - new task should be saved in an array as an object so that we could keep more properties
2. When user clicks on a task - should find the item and update a property showing that is done
3. When user clicks on an X it should find the item in the array and remove it from the array
4. When user clicks on a clear all button it should clear all items from the array
